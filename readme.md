# In my own words

## What is this?

> Writing lessons learned in notebooks has proved slow and disorganized for me

When learning new material, putting it in my own words greatly increases my comprehension and retension. This is the home for that! As a programmer, "my own words" may take many forms: text, markdown, and other languages. But, this is not a place for *only* programming lessons. The format for each entry should be what best maps to the material.
