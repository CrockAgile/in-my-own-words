# Introduction to Algorithms - CLRS

## Motivation
I strap on my tool belt and approach my workbench.
My project remains just how I left it yesterday.
Only a few minutes into working, a fresh challenge presents itself.
I reach a hand down to hover over my tool belt, passing over the line of worn handles.
I hesitate, debating the proper tool for the job.
One tool has proven itself up to many similar tasks in the past, but today's seems different.
Today's problem has a special constraint which makes my default tool awkward to hold.
If only it had a different handle.
Or maybe a different shape?
I imagine the abstract outline of such a tool.
Does such a tool exist?
I look to my tool belt and see nothing of resemblance.
Turning slowly to my wall's tool rack, I ready for disappointment.
Nothing.
A draft blows thru my workshop.
But even in my workshop, I find myself standing at a critical junction.
And I have been here before.
And I know what will happen.
One road leads to the hardware store, where I can wander for hours, usually without results.
Or I could return to my work, and make do with the tool I have.
I know which path will be taken because I know who owns the project.
If it is only my project, then I will peruse the store's wares, come up short, and abandon my project.
But I do not own today's project.
Today I must return to work.
I must show progress.
I must meet deadlines.
By the end of the day, I will deliver a product that works decently, and has a weird little dent from the wrong tool.
